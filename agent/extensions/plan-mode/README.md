# Plan Mode Extension

Read-only exploration mode for safe code analysis.

## Features

- **Built-in write tools disabled**: Disables edit/write while preserving other active tools
- **Bash allowlist**: Only read-only bash commands are allowed
- **Plan extraction**: Extracts numbered steps from `Plan:` sections
- **Bordered plan card**: Shows the complete plan once in a spacious purple box with markdown styling
- **Completion card**: Green bordered card with struck-through steps when the plan finishes
- **Compact progress widget**: Shows done count, current step, and next steps during execution
- **Save to file**: Optional `PLAN.md` export from the decision dialog
- **[DONE:n] markers**: Explicit step completion tracking
- **Session persistence**: State survives session resume

## Commands

- `/plan` - Toggle plan mode
- `/todos` - Render the current plan progress card
- `Shift+Tab` - Toggle between plan and regular mode (shortcut)

## Usage

1. Enable plan mode with `Shift+Tab`, `/plan`, or the `--plan` flag
2. Ask the agent to analyze code and create a plan
3. The agent should output a numbered plan under a `Plan:` header:

```
Plan:
1. First step description
2. Second step description
3. Third step description
```

4. Review the bordered plan card and choose: execute, stay, refine, or save to `PLAN.md`
5. During execution, the agent marks steps complete with `[DONE:n]` tags
6. Progress widget shows completion status

## How It Works

### Plan Mode (Read-Only)
- Built-in edit/write tools disabled
- Other active tools remain available
- Bash commands filtered through allowlist
- Agent creates a plan without making changes

### Execution Mode
- Full tool access restored
- Agent executes steps in order
- `[DONE:n]` markers track completion
- Widget shows progress

### Command Allowlist

Safe commands (allowed):
- File inspection: `cat`, `head`, `tail`, `less`, `more`
- Search: `grep`, `find`, `rg`, `fd`
- Directory: `ls`, `pwd`, `tree`
- Git read: `git status`, `git log`, `git diff`, `git branch`
- Package info: `npm list`, `npm outdated`, `yarn info`
- System info: `uname`, `whoami`, `date`, `uptime`

Blocked commands:
